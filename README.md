# Computer Vision Projects

This is a repo with our computer vision project of 2017 second semester at University of Campinas - Brazil with prof. Adin Rivera. It contains:

* Makefile: This scripts setups the environment to run a project on adnrv/opencv docker image, change it in order to run an specific project.
* project-proposal: Project for final course project, the repo with the project may be released later.
* template: A basic template for each mini-project.
* HW0, HW1. HW2. HW3. HW4: mini-projects, each one of them always have:
   * Makefile: Runs each project inside the adnrv/opencv enviroment.
   * input: Directory with the files used as input, in some cases the files are download by Makefile.
   * outputs: In some cases empty, the results of each project are stored here.
   * p*.pdf: statement of the project.
   * dbg: Partial results or extra scripts used in the project/report.
   * report: Report presented in each project, they explain our solutions and results.
   * src: Our solutions, mostly implemented in python

The topics of each mini-project are:

* HW0: OpenCV basics, this includes color planes, replacement of pixels, noise, arithmetic and geometric operations.
* HW1: Blending using gaussian/laplacian pyramids, also some experiments with frequency domain blending.
* HW2: Video stabilization.
* HW3: Structure from motion.
* HW4: Image Retrieval.

Each one of them has a README.md that explains some details but report/report.pdf contains an extended explanation.

Don't forget to give us a fork/star!!
