\section{Previous Things}

The output of the code includes: results for clustering, conected components and an archive \textit{results.txt} that will be saved in the \textit{output} directory. The files with the computed descriptor will be generated in the \textit{input} directory and need to be computed just once. Run $make$ to run the whole homework.

The archive \textit{results.txt} has 1 line for each image input and shows the best 3 results sorted in decreasing order of its similarity to the query image.
