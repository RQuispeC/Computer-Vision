\section{Image Descriptor}

For the implementation of the clustering we consider OpenCV implementation of K-means, and for the connected components we implemented a Breadth-First Search, the results for clustering are shown in figure \ref{fig:clusters}. We apply a median filter before the clustering in order to remove noise while preserving edges. Experiments with different numbers of clusters $K$ are computed ($K = 2, 4, 8$).

Comparing the results of figure \ref{fig:clusters}, with a low number of clusters, the scene loses its essence because the parts with similar color but belonging to different entities get joint, while with a bigger number its look more natural and is similar to the original one but creates smaller areas that are redundant and less discriminative.

The results for the connected components are shown in figure \ref{fig:components}, note that there are black areas (components), they have less than $threshold$ pixels and are not considered in further steps. We evaluate differents values of $threshold$ ($threshold = 100, 300 $).

\end{figure}

From figure \ref{fig:components} we can see that the number of clusters has big impact in the components, note that in the case of $K= 8$ there are several areas with small size, for this reason we consider a $threshold$ in the size of each component.

In order to describe the image we evaluate:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Size of region}: The number of pixels of each component is considered as feature.
\item \textbf{Mean color}: The mean color was calculated indendly for each channel.
\item \textbf{Contrast}: This metric was computed from the gray co-occurrence matrix, we use \textit{scikit-image} implementation of this function.
\item \textbf{Correlation}: This metric was computed from the gray co-occurrence matrix, we use \textit{scikit-image} implementation of this function.
\item \textbf{Entropy}: This metric was computed from the gray co-occurrence matrix given by \textit{scikit-image}, we implemented this function from the scratch.
\item \textbf{Centroid of the region}: We consider the concept of moments to compute this feature.
\item \textbf{Bounding box}: We consider as bounding box, the quadrilateral that involves the component, with its sides parallel to image sides, and the feature is the size of the diagonal of this bounding box.
\end{itemize}

In section \ref{sec:experiments} we compare different combinations of these features.
