\section{Input data and remarks}
The video used for the experiments will be downloaded by command $make~data$, but input along with outputs are \href{https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1h46SOyOOVAdXRPX2l1VlBBSDg}{available at this: \textit{link}}. This project has an extra directory named “my-output” that contains the $.ply$ file previously generated.

Command $make$ will download the input and run the project. Output tracking results of each frame as well as the $.ply$ is generated in directory $output$, note that this may take a while.
